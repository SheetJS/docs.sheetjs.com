title: NoSQL Data Stores
---

So-called "Schema-less" databases allow for arbitrary keys and values within the
entries in the database.  K/V stores and Objects add additional restrictions.

:::note

These data stores are capable of storing structured data.  Those use cases are
covered in the [Database demo](./database).

:::

There is no natural way to translate arbitrarily shaped schemas to worksheets
in a workbook.  One common trick is to dedicate one worksheet to holding named
keys.  For example, considering the JS object:

```json
{
  "title": "SheetDB",
  "metadata": {
    "author": "SheetJS",
    "code": 7262
  },
  "data": [
    { "Name": "Barack Obama", "Index": 44 },
    { "Name": "Donald Trump", "Index": 45 },
  ]
}
```

A dedicated worksheet should store the one-off named values:

```
XXX|        A        |    B    |
---+-----------------+---------+
 1 | Path            | Value   |
 2 | title           | SheetDB |
 3 | metadata.author | SheetJS |
 4 | metadata.code   |    7262 |
```
